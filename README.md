# PHP / MySQL school project

## About project

This project was made on my first study year by a team of 5 students. The purpose was to make a responsive online store with the main emphasis on PHP, CodeIgniter and MySQL. We made a particularly delicious candy store. The site has categories for different candies, some of the candies belonging to several groups. You can log in or order without logging in. In the shopping cart you can change the number of products you want to order. In addition, we made an admin site where you can view and edit orders, product categories and products. This was extremely motivating and interesting project. I especially liked the database side and it was mostly my responsibility to develop it. Of course, the coding of the site itself was also inspiring. Our team was really dedicated to this project and we often worked well into the evening. The teacher’s comment of our work was “I would give a seven, but a five is the best you can give”.
